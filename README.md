The Project Story
## Inspiration
Have you ever felt that your meetings are going into circles and that you are having a hard time streamlining your inputs, decisions and follow up actions? Well, now with minutely AI is here to assist you and get your meetings to the next level, with this amazing team productivity app you can get all your meeting minutes recorded, transcribed and forwarded automatically to all the meeting participants with a list of action items on-the-go

## What it does
We have designed the app to be simple, intuitive and yet powerful with a complete user-centric approach, everything works with a simple button push, your meeting can be either transcribed in real-time, or you can upload a meeting recording, then our backend takes over to provide sentiment analysis, identify action items and forward the MoMs to the meeting participants
 
## How we built it
Building it was thanks to the work or 3 Data Scientists, a Front-end developer, a Back-end developer and a UX/UI designer. We all come from the corporate world where we are having countless meetings everyday and a solution to streamline and automate all the inefficiencies in today's corporate world became a necessity. It all started by a design brainstorming where we did put all possible features we could think of and the prioritizing them. After that we split the workshare among the team members according to the skills. We started first coding the speech2text technobrick using the DeepSpeech model and benchmarking it with other models on the market

## Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges we have faced, especially as we were a Hybrid team with 2 people present physically on-site and the rest participating remotely, and this is more of a logistics challenge that can also tell us about how challenging it is to make hybrid workplaces,
On the technical side, we ran into a major challenge in matters of available Speech2Text technologies that are good enough for the quality standards we have set ourselves. Basically, all speech2Text Packages/APIs that are available are proprietary, which means they are not for free
